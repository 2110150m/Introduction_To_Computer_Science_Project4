// Unfortunately, we cannot press a key by setting the value of RAM[0x24576], 
// as the CPU emulator refreshes this value as part of its execution cycle.
//
// Experiments using expect were not a success, suggesting the CPU emulator
// does not use standard in for input.  A possible alternative, xdotool, 
// seems hard to learn and may not work on Gradescope's VMs as they probably 
// don't run Xwindows.
// 
// So we will test only the "no key pressed" behavior and leave the rest to 
// interactive testing as needed.
